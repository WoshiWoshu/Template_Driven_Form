Small project in Angular + Node.js in which the goal is to create a simple form component using Angular template syntax. I am also using ngModel to create two-way data bindings for reading and writing input-control values, template reference variables to share information across HTML elements and CSS classes for handling/displaying validation errors form controls component's behavior.
The form contains several required fields mark with blue/green/red left sidebars along a submit button which can be used only if requirements are satisfied.

The project is based on an Angular form tutorial wich can be found here : https://angular.io/guide/forms.
